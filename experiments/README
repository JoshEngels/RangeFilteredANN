## Milvus

Install: pymilvus (pip install), [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).

```bash
# start docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# copy yaml and yml file to home directory / from experiments/
cp RangeFilteredANN/experiments/*.yaml ./
cp RangeFilteredANN/experiments/*.yml ./

# start milvus
sudo docker compose up -d

# prepare to connect to milvus
docker port milvus-standalone 19530/tcp

# test
python3 tests/test_milvus_connection.py 
```

Run
```bash
python3 run_milvus.py 
```
Note that if you want to change the number of threads used, you need to change both THREADS in run_milvus.py and OMP_NUM_THREADS in docker-copmose.yml, and re-start docker. 

stop milvus
```bash
sudo docker compose down
```
